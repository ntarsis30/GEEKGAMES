As the sun set over the Digitaldale University campus, casting long shadows between the buildings, a small group of Professor Quack Quack's closest colleagues 
gathered in the dimly lit corner of the faculty lounge. Among them were Dr. Binary Beak, a renowned AI specialist, and Ms. Codea Feather, an expert in software 
engineering. Both had worked alongside the professor for years, contributing to numerous groundbreaking projects. Their camaraderie, however, was a fa√ßade, masking a 
simmering envy towards the rubber duck's acclaim and influence.

The plot was sinister yet ingeniously simple, devised to use the very essence of what Professor Quack Quack loved most: cryptography. 
The conspirators chose the Caesar cipher, a method the professor often used to introduce his students to the world of encryption, to 
encode a message that would lead him to his doom.

The message, when decrypted, would reveal the coordinates to a remote part of the digital archives where the professor stored his most 
sensitive research. Dr. Beak and Ms. Feather had tampered with the environmental controls of the server room at those coordinates, 
ensuring that upon the professor's entry, the systems would overload, erasing decades of his work and trapping him in a web of 
malfunctioning security protocols.

On the eve of his disappearance, Professor Quack Quack was betrayed by someone close to him at the Stony Brook Computing Society. The last words he heard were,
"Y tu Brute?" and he was visciously attacked by a group of students.

Applying the Caesar cipher, he encrypted a message to help those who were to find out, revealing information on his demise. With his last breath, he rushed to the location, deeply hurt by the betrayal of those closest to him.
