Here are some nice numbers we found in the killer's lair

N = 3233
[669, 28, 28, 597, 119, 669, 2790, 3123, 28, 2680, 855, 2159, 3000, 28, 1992, 597, 1486, 2726, 2726, 28, 1859, 1992, 1759, 1307, 28, 2680, 1992, 3165, 1307, 2159, 1992, 597, 3165, 1307, 604, 1992, 1859, 2680, 2790, 1516]

I wonder what this could mean

Hint: try using RSA and assume that the killer is super basic with his key
