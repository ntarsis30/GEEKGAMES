Chapter 3: Decrypting the Enigma

In the unsettling quiet that followed Professor Quack Quack's disappearance, Ada Byte, a student known for her coding prowess, stumbled upon an anomaly within the professor's digital notes. Amidst structured documents lay a perplexing file named "Quack's Conundrum," filled with a bewildering array of characters. Recognizing the pattern as Brainfuck, an esoteric programming language esteemed for its minimalistic yet complex nature, Ada's curiosity was piqued.

Dedicating herself to the task, Ada embarked on a meticulous journey through the convoluted Brainfuck code. The language's eight simple commands masked a sophisticated cryptographic puzzle that Professor Quack Quack had cleverly crafted. The decoded message led Ada to a specific portion of the professor's last lecture, which contained hidden numerical sequences under the guise of a discussion on quantum computing vulnerabilities.

These sequences were, in fact, coordinates to a heavily encrypted segment of the university's digital archives, rumored to house the professor's revolutionary cybersecurity research. The protection was formidable, with a dynamic Caesar cipher whose shifting key told us about the professor's brain was fucked! (clue!)
